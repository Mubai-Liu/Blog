A long time ago, I dreamed to build a PC completely by myself. The eager of wanting a high performance PC is just my motivation and keep me thinking about that. Nevertheless, I am not able to do so for such a long time due to the limitation of space and time. And of course, my wallet.

Therefore, I came with this budget build for now and it did work! The hardware at first seems having some trouble of outputing signals to the monitor, and I thought it might be some malfunction of CPU or Mobo. Well, it turns out that the problem is that AMD cpu lacks of integrated graphic cards and my HDMI cable is connected to the motherboard io not the graphic cards.

I's so excited when I figure out this problem by searching through the web and try if it works for me cause I really start to thinking return those hardwares back.
