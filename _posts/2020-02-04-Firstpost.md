I've never thought I would have such huge amount of interests to start a blog, but here I am. It is apparently a low reward, high cost job to do, and kept me away from doing so since the day I was born. 

I also tried to building the website page by using wordpress, but it turns out using that is not efficient and even required money to do so if you really want to get things down beautifully. The previous website page is [here](http://mubaiblog.epizy.com/). As you may notice, its server requires a lot of time to respond because I'm using totally free domain and hosting. While now I've found the github page to be so easy to use and it's totally free, so I'll simply put all my related work and post here from now on.

I'd like to share some of the reasons I believe that keep me want to have a blog like this.

## Writing Skills

As a Chinese student, it is not that easy to convey all of my thought into English efficiently by writing. If I want some place to enhance my writing skills, a blog would be the best one as it only serve a purpose for interests instead of some previous exams wrinting taught by teachers. To me it's more enjoyable to do and it have no hint during the writing process unlike writing something in word.

Also, this blog serves a purpose to communicate with other people who may notice me. And if they are interested in something I've posted, the way I'm conveying my ideas become really important. Have I made a clear statement to them? That's a question I'll keep in mind if I'm continuing posting.

## Building a Curriculum

This is also a place to share my knowledge and experiences. I'm probably going to post all my related work to this website and to share my process of learning during through my life. If there is a chance that future recruiters somehow find this place, it probably will create a better accurate image of who I am and what I've done.

## Recorded My Thoughts
Whenever I have a new idea or understand a new concept, I need someplace or someone to talk to in order to get the feedback. Well, because finding someone who are willing to talk with you is more difficult, then starting to write a blog seems to be a good way to solve this question. And it can't disappear probably for a long time so that I can come back and check what I've done in the previous year. Don't have to worry about losing memories, huh?

Wish that this is a good start, and looking forward to train myself more and enhancing my skills more in the future.

**Good luck!**
