# Background Discussion

## Q1: What makes predicting voter behavior (and thus election forecasting) a hard problem?

Many reasons may lead to the difficulty of predicting the voter behavior and election forecasting. The first one may be the number of voters for the
2016’s polls. While we expect that the equal number of Democrats and Republicians, it turned out that the Republican have much more voters than Democratic voters. Secondly, voters may change their decidion. Several causes are whether or not the voter is a minority, their income earned, and the gender of those voters. We should analyze all those factors that may have influence on individual’s vote. What's more,it turns out that
many voters would change their vote in the week that leads up to voting according to previous elections. Last but not least, unpredictable future events that will happen. The society may change their attitude due to the news they’ve found on the TV or website, which is not predcitable.

## Q2: Although Nate Silver predicted that Clinton would win 2016, he gave Trump higher odds than most. What is unique about Nate Silver’s methodology?

## Q3:

# Data Wrangling


# Visualization

```r
states = map_data("state")

ggplot(data = states) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = region, group = group), color = "white") + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  guides(fill=FALSE)  # color legend is unnecessary and takes too long
```

```r
counties = map_data("county")

ggplot(data = counties)+
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = region, group = group), color = "white") + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  guides(fill=FALSE)  # color legend is unnecessary and takes too long
```

# Dimension Reduction

# Classification

# Conclusion and Future Thoughts
