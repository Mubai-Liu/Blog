I'm a Master of Arts Student at Columbia who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations. Currently I'm taking deep learning course and more advanced machine learning courses to enhance my skills. I finished my undergraduates in University of California, Santa Barbara with Degrees in Mathematics Science and Statistical Science.

Now I'm looking for a summer internship in 2020 and building up my personal blog with some thought I'm having during the process of studying. Feel free to contact me if you are also interested in studying machine learning or if there is an opportunity to help me get an intern. You can find my contact information from the left side bar of the page or contact me through my telephone: 805-453-6178
